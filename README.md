# omniverse_frontier
Omniverse Frontier is a 3D multi-mode combat simulation built using OpenGL, designed to demonstrate advanced computer graphics concepts, real-time interaction, and AI-driven gameplay systems.
The project simulates defense and invasion scenarios across multiple small-scale universes, where each universe represents a distinct combat environment with unique enemy designs, behaviors, and visual identities.
Rather than focusing on a single gameplay style, the project is structured as a modular combat engine that supports multiple fighting modes including vehicle combat, aerial combat, weapon-only combat, and experimental hybrid modes.
Each universe contains three progressive enemy tiers and a final boss, ensuring structured difficulty escalation while keeping the playable area compact and computationally manageable.
The goal of the simulation is to defend the player’s universe from invading forces and strategically attack hostile universes, showcasing the integration of 3D transformations, camera systems, AI behavior, collision detection, and real-time rendering.
